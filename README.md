# Actuali

A native iOS companion app for [Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.org/), the local-first personal finance tool. Actuali talks directly to your self-hosted Actual server using the same CRDT sync protocol as Actual's own clients, so it works offline and merges cleanly with edits made anywhere else.

This is an unofficial community project. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Actual Budget team.

## Features

- Accounts: net worth and balances across on-budget and off-budget accounts
- Transactions: browse and search your full history; add expenses, deposits, and transfers
- Budget: category-by-category budgeted vs. spent for the current month
- Reports: spending, net worth, and cash flow widgets
- iOS Shortcuts: a "Log Transaction" intent for Siri, widgets, and automations
- Sign in with password or **OpenID Connect / OAuth** — the app detects which methods your server offers
- Offline-first: every budget lives locally in SQLite; changes sync back automatically via Actual's CRDT protocol
- **Light & dark mode**
- No analytics, no third-party tracking. The app talks only to the Actual server you configure.

## Requirements

- A self-hosted [Actual Budget server](https://actualbudget.org/docs/install/) you can reach from your phone
- iOS 26.1 or later

## Building from source

You'll need Xcode with the iOS 26.1+ SDK. Dependencies (GRDB.swift, SwiftProtobuf, ZIPFoundation) are managed by Xcode's Swift Package Manager and resolve on first build.

```bash
# Open in Xcode
open Actuali/Actuali.xcodeproj

# Or build from the command line
xcodebuild -project Actuali/Actuali.xcodeproj -scheme Actuali -sdk iphonesimulator build

# Regenerate protobuf code (only if sync.proto changes)
protoc --swift_out=Actuali/Actuali/Generated/ Actuali/Actuali/Resources/sync.proto
```

## Architecture

```
UI (SwiftUI Views)

BudgetStore (@MainActor, ObservableObject)
    ↓
Services Layer
├── BudgetDatabase (GRDB) → SQLite
├── SyncClient (actor) → CRDT sync engine
└── ActualServerClient (actor) → Network
```

The sync engine (`Actuali/Actuali/Services/Sync/`) implements Actual's CRDT protocol: a hybrid logical clock for causality ordering, a Merkle tree for efficient diffing, field-level CRDT messages, and protobuf encoding. Writes go to local SQLite first, generate CRDT messages, and sync to the server with a short debounce; reads are plain SQLite queries.

## Relationship to Actual Budget

Actuali is a companion client, not a fork or replacement. It requires an Actual server and stores nothing anywhere else. The sync engine is a Swift port of Actual's CRDT implementation (`packages/crdt` and `packages/loot-core` in the [upstream repo](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual)), which is MIT-licensed — see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the attribution notice. For development, the upstream repo can be cloned into `actual/` (gitignored) as a reference implementation.
